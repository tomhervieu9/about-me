Hey there ðŸ˜ƒ, my name is Thomas and I'm looking for roles in web development.

On my Github, you will mainly find my recent web development code (most of which is currently practice exercises). My academic work is private for copyright reasons.

**My experience can be summed up as:**  
2 years data engineering (academic)  
3 years software development (professional)  
6 months self-taught web development
